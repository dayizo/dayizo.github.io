          I am glad that it said, "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding" - Proverbs 4:7
If wisdom and understanding are the final frontiers, then knowledge will precede them and discipline will be the start point.
My life has revolved around these. Discipline in the pursuit of knowledge and its application for the betterment of mankind. A never ending journey yes, but with the right company (pun intended) dreams become realities and achievements, histories. 
As a mathematician and computer scientist, I have a grasp on both the past and the future in order to make the best of the present day.
Having been affiliated with the educational and telecommunications industry,  I have over the years understood how minds work and have been privileged to have worked with some elite minds. My time as a teacher has taught me patience, steadfastness and also to have an open minded attitude towards others and anything. These of course came in handy as I was ushered into the telecommunications industry where demand for support services is on a high and a calm nerve is required to make the best decisions in very little time. I believe I have been moulded into a rare form and I am set to make my mark in the world.

          As a mathematician and computer scientist, I have a grasp on both the past and the future in order to make the best of the present day. The 1s and 0s, world behind the world, which has now become my abode. The internet and all it's magnificence. An unseen reality that has now become the reality of many like myself. I am determined to be 
          invested in this world as I am it no doubt that it has become a force to reckon with. To deny this, is to deny one's self.
